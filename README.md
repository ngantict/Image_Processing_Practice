# Image Processing Practice

=============================

## Labwork 1:

1. Read, show image
2. Resize image
3. Change brightness
4. Histogram equalization
5. Image thresholding

## Labwork 2:

1. Load, read image and plot histogram
2. Apply averaging filter, Gaussian filter, median filter
3. Add Gaussian noise, Salt and Pepper noise, Periodic noise
4. Apply filters to denoise images
5. Transform periodic noisy image to frequency domain, denoise, and transform back to spatial domain.

## Labwork 3:

1. Apply Laplacian filter, Sobel filter
2. Apply Canny filter
3. Apply Hough Lines
4. Apply different segmentation and compare with global thresholding

## Erosion_dilation:

1. Erosion
2. Dilation
3. Opening
4. Closing
